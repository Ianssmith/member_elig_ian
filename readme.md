Program to generate eligiblity reports
1. 
- given the 2 files I calculate the toal number of members months
- the result contains the members id, full name and the number of months
- the report is generated in json format and partitioned by membersID
2. 
- calculating the total number of member months by year
- show memberID month [I acutually changed it to use 'year' since the prompt was to group by year] and total number of member months/year in json

## json output 
- first showing total member months located in '/out/total_member_months
- second showing total member months per year located in '/out/member_months_per_year'
